# lets see if we can figure something out for this survival pool

```{r}
url <- "https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/nfl-api/nfl_elo_latest.csv"

DF <- read_csv(url)
```

```{r}
head(DF, 50)
```

Ok seems, like the data is pretty nice, I'll pretty much want to run this all through the cmd line, so lets build the github repo and go from there

```{r}
#get todays date

Sys.Date()

#ok perfect but i want the whole week

Date_Check = c(Sys.Date(), Sys.Date() + 2,  Sys.Date() + 3, 
               Sys.Date() + 4, Sys.Date() + 5, Sys.Date() + 6,
               Sys.Date() + 7)
```


```{r}
DF.current <- DF %>% 
  filter(date %in% Date_Check)
```
